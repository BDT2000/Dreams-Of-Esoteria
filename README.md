# Dreams of Esoteria

### TODO
- create idle states/better animation logic for player (AnimTree?)
- camera for player node
- different sprites for player/characters?
- player behind building, fade building to see behind when player is there

### Description

Style: 2D top-down pixel art
Premise: Musical city adventure. Music is structural, enforced/incentivised to play in a certain way. 
Journey of the game is challenging this structure across different musical domains, guided by dream
experiences. Bosses embody different elements of music. When defeated, the world changes and allows 
more freedom and diversity. 

There are a few final bosses, beginning with The Composer (curator of music in the world, sends 
notation through pipes), then Algorhythm (embodying the role of algorhythms), and finally the 
Creator (embodying bias, and the source of arbitrary measures of success).

###Themes

#### Structure

A prominent theme is challenging prescribed ways to do music in the world and pursuing creativity.
There are various forces in the world that direct the player (elements of music) in different ways, 
and most can be challenged at some point.

#### Dreams

At inflection points in the narrative (maybe specific sleeping locations), dreams will allow the player
to engage in a musical interaction with an embodiment of the musical concept in a fluid way that opens 
up contrasting musical thoughts against what is enforced/incentivised (eg. rhythm: grooves, 
syncopation, polyrhythm; pitch: semitonal, microtonal, irrational ratios).

#### Music

Elements of music make up parts of the city and society, and explore various manifestations of power,
conformity, and control. These categories don't necessarily correspond to discrete physical areas. 
They might be elements that exist throughout the city like transport.

Rhythm:
	- transport/movement
	- walking/running/sneaking
	- metro/rail (MetroGnome)
	
Dynamics:
	- entertainment
	- silence prison/punishment
	- tricky for keyboard, maybe shift/ctrl, or different buttons
	- velocity
	
Melody:
	- lots of uncertainties around this as a space, depends on mechanics
	- Garden? (M'Lady)
	- Factory/work/education
	- initially played but later sequencer comes in
	
Pitch:
	- Tall tower that also extends underground
	- Height corresponding to pitch
	- Lower is bass, drones, fundamental freq's (industry, Low freq=mechanical?)
	- Middle is different ratios etc. (Science/R&D)
	- Top is communication tower emitting high freq signals

Timbre:
	- sampling; outskirts of city not as aurally regulated; natural sounds such as wind, waves, brids etc.

Harmony:
	- guitar/strings
	- pipes with ope part having string which can be played

Modality:
	- 7 diatonic modes (Ionian; Ian, Dorian; Dory, Phrygian; Fry, Lydian; Lydia, Mixolydian; Mick, Aeolian; Leo, Locrian; Lachie)

Form/Composition:
	- sequencing
	- multi-tracks
	
FX:
	- different rooms in a building
	- experimental facility

### Setting

Name ideas: Syncity

Structure (narrative progression):
	- Beginning get an intro to rhythm and movement in the world
	- Structure of progression to different areas not entirely linear, can go different ways, but 
	some areas are prereqs to others. The below is still in progress
	- Rhythm -> Dynamics
	-        -> Timbre -> FX
	- Melody -> Tonality?
	-        -> Modality?
	-        -> Harmony
	- Rhythm & Melody -> Form
	- As more bosses are defeated, increasing measures to bring about order are deployed (algorhythm, 
	drones, etc)

### Technical Considerations

Dreams => sleep => beds. Where are beds how do you keep exploring whilst having somewhere to sleep? 
Venture out from same place each day? Or have different sleeping locations?
Animation in sync with beat of music

### Ideas

For each musical section, defeating the boss gives access to something or new ability of some kind
- harmony; ability to add samples to
- form; sequencer; begins with melody and rhythm but can later get harmony, pedals etc.
- FX; pedals, revisit areas to get pedals? delay; rhythm, loop; form
- melody; melody instrument of some kind
- rhythm; control over time?
